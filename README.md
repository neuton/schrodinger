Animation of a direct numerical solution to the time-dependent Schroedinger equation.
This straight-forward integration is intended for illustratory purposes and does not provide great precision/convergence.
Supports both 1D and 2D.

Two slits simulation example:
```bash
./wave2d.py 100 160 -d=10 -2
```
